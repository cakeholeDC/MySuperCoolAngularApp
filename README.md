# U-BREW
U-BREW is simple Angular app for finding breweries by state. Select a state from the dropdown to view the top 50 results for that state.

Brewery data is sourced in real time from the [openbrewerydb API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org). Results are displayed in the order in which the API delivers them, not popularity or rating.
